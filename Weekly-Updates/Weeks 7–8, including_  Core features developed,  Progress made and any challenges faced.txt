Scope Statement: Connect Plus

Connect Plus is a collaboration and group-management platform built to make teamwork and communication simpler for classmates, community groups, and small teams.

While tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Drive cater to large companies and structured organizations, Connect Plus focuses on everyday users who need a balanced, affordable, and easy-to-use way to coordinate group work.

It combines real-time chat, task organization, meeting management, and alerts into one clean, intuitive app — designed for clarity and collaboration, not complexity.

 What Makes Connect Plus Stand Out
Feature	Why It Matters	How Connect Plus Improves It
Simplified Group Communication	Tools like Slack and Teams are built for corporate structures and can feel overwhelming.	A modern, streamlined interface focused on communication and coordination — not corporate setup.
Built-in Tasks & Meetings	Other platforms require separate tools for chat, meetings, and task management.	Everything — messaging, meeting scheduling, and task tracking — is integrated in one platform.
Open to Everyone	Many “student” apps are limited to schools or educational emails.	Anyone can sign up and create groups — whether for study, side projects, freelance work, or clubs.
Status & Help Features	Most platforms don’t make it easy to request help or show availability.	Integrated “Need Help” and “Status” systems keep communication transparent and supportive.
 Why It’s Different

Connect Plus is built for people, not companies — designed to help classmates, small teams, and community groups manage work together effortlessly.

It bridges the gap between simple messaging apps and overwhelming corporate platforms, offering a balanced solution that’s:

 Communication-first

 Organized (built-in tasks & meetings)

 Lightweight & fast

 Free for all essential features
