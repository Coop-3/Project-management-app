Scope

The goal of learning React was to understand how to build dynamic, interactive, and reusable user interfaces for web applications. Since React is widely used in modern web development, mastering its concepts helps in creating efficient, component-based applications—such as my Campus Connect Plus project.

This phase of learning focused on understanding how React works, how to use components, manage state, and interact with the Virtual DOM efficiently.

 What I Learned
1. What React Is
React is an external JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It is not built into JavaScript—it’s external code written by others that we load into our project.
React can be used to build both web and mobile applications:
react → core shared features
react-dom → features specific to the web
react-native → used for mobile apps
2. React Setup and Project Structure

I learned two ways to create a React app:

Regular React setup (using Create React App)
Vite, which is faster and simpler

The structure includes:

node_modules/ – all installed libraries (don’t edit these)
public/ – static assets like images and videos
src/ – contains the app’s source code (main logic lives here)
index.html – the base HTML template
package.json – stores project info and dependencies
vite.config.js or tsconfig.json – configuration files (rarely modified)
3. Components
Components are the building blocks of React.
They allow modular, reusable, and organized code.
A React app is made by combining multiple components together:
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

4. JSX (JavaScript XML)
JSX looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript under the hood.
It makes UI code readable and expressive:
const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>;

5. Props and State
Props → Allow data to be passed from one component to another:
<User name="Alex" />

State → Internal data that can change inside a component:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

6. Events
Event handling in React is done with camelCase syntax:
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click</button>

7. Virtual DOM
React uses a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
When something changes, React compares the new virtual DOM with the old one and updates only the parts that changed — making apps faster.
8. Hooks
Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext allow functional components to use features like state and lifecycle methods without classes.
9. Rendering Lists
In React, we don’t use loops like for directly inside JSX. Instead, we use .map() to render lists:
{items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}

Each item must have a unique key prop so React can track changes efficiently.
10. Bootstrap Integration
Learned how to install and import Bootstrap to style components easily:
npm install bootstrap

Import it into main.tsx or App.tsx to apply global styles.


 Difficulties & Challenges
At first, I was confused about the difference between React (core library) and ReactDOM (web-specific library).
Understanding how JSX compiles to JavaScript was challenging but became clearer with practice.
Remembering to always give elements a unique key when rendering lists was something I learned after debugging warnings.
Managing multiple imports and understanding how modules connect in a React project required repetition and hands-on coding.

Why This Was Important

Learning React helps me bring the project-management-app vision to life by enabling:

Interactive dashboards that respond instantly to user input.
Modular and reusable components for tasks, meetings, and profile sections.
Faster updates through the Virtual DOM for a smoother user experience.
