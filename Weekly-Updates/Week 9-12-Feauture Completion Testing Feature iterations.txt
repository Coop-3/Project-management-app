📘 Overview

This stage covers developing the user authentication system, including:

Login

Signup

Forgot Password

Username Reset

Google and GitHub OAuth integrations

These features help users securely access their Connect+ accounts and data.

🔍 Purpose

Authentication ensures user security and controlled access.
Users can:

Create an account

Log in securely

Reset their credentials when needed

Use OAuth for quicker login

⚙️ What Was Implemented
Feature	Description
Login Page	Allows users to access their account via email and password.
Signup Page	New users register using their details.
Forgot Password	Sends reset link to the user’s email.
Username Reset	Helps users recover their username.
OAuth (Google/GitHub)	Users can log in quickly using existing accounts.

All authentication routes were connected to MongoDB using Mongoose models and tested through Thunder Client.

🧠 Challenges Faced
Issue	Description	Resolution
MongoDB Atlas not connecting	We faced an ENOTFOUND and bad auth error when connecting.	Corrected .env MONGO_URI format and confirmed user credentials on MongoDB Atlas.
Thunder Client Invalid URL	“Invalid URL” message appeared when testing POST routes.	Fixed by verifying the local server URL: http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register.
Login/Signup styling	The initial page didn’t match the design.	Adjusted CSS and layout using Bootstrap and custom styles.
Vite dependency errors	Bootstrap import path was incorrect.	Corrected path and reinstalled missing dependencies.
🧩 Lessons Learned

Environment variables must be placed in the server folder, not client.

MongoDB connection strings must exactly match Atlas credentials.

Thunder Client is great for API testing but sensitive to typos in routes.

Maintaining a clear folder structure prevents import confusion.

🧰 Tools Used

React for building the UI.

Bootstrap for responsive form styling.

Express.js + Mongoose for backend and database.

Thunder Client for API testing.

MongoDB Atlas for cloud data storage.
